## Requires

PHP_VERSION >= 8.0

## Description

The idea behind this module is to take the functions of [php-apm](https://pecl.php.net/package/APM) that Pantheon uses in it's webops environments and port those functions to a [PHP 8.0](https://php.net) clean extension.

When enabled, this module will take an error or thowable event happening in PHP8 and push debugging information about the event to a https REST endpoint.

## Installation

```bash
phpize
make
make install
```

## Credit Where Due

This module is based on the fantastic work of Davide Mendolia & Patrick Allaert who created the original PHP-APM module.

Big props to the [PHP INTERNALS BOOK](https://www.phpinternalsbook.com) and the super-whip-smart people at [Seiden Group](https://www.seidengroup.com/2020/12/07/porting-extensions-to-php-8/)

Thank you [Sara Golemon](https://github.com/sgolemon), for quite literally writing the [book](https://flylib.com/books/en/2.565.1/) on php internals.

This module is sponsored by and enabled in production on [PANTHEON](https://pantheon.io)&rsquo;s WEBOPS CMS hosting platform (this line to be vetted by product and legal before PECL extension is published).
